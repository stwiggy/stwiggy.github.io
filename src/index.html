        <p>Cindy is a little fairy princess. Ever since she was little, she lived in her little whimsical, fantastical world. </p>
        <p>“What was your breakfast?” her friends would ask.</p>
        <p>And with a wide smile and sparkling eyes, “A little fairy pancake and fairy sprinkles!”</p>
        <p>But the princess life was a double edged sword. For her family’s sake and against her will, she was put into an arranged marriage. Her little dainty feet forced into the dainty glass shoes, her multi-tiered dress drowning her. Her mature makeup couldn’t cover up her baby face. She looked the part. She didn’t feel the part. </p>
        <p>Her overbearing prince taught her a world of new things. She learned that waistbands could hurt and hangers could leave scars. Trapped in her magic castle, she could only look out the window and up at the clouds. Where she thought she belonged.</p>
        <p>Cindy was a little fairy princess.</p>
